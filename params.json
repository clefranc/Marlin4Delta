{"name":"Marlindev","tagline":"Custom Marlin firmware from MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev specifically optimized for deltas (download the delta_calibration branch). See MarlinFirmware/Marlin for official releases.","body":"### Welcome to my forked Marlin firmware.\r\nMarlin was originally derived from [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter) and [Grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) by Erik van der Zalm in 2011. Its main repository is located at GitHub: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin and a developer repository: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev. Delta robot code was introduced in June 2013.\r\n\r\nSince 2015, Marlin have migrated to its own GitHub organization: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nMarlin is published under the GPL license because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.\r\n\r\nWhile we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this fork? Go to my GitHub repository for MarlinDev fork at https://github.com/clefranc/MarlinDev and raise an issue.\r\n","google":"UA-67195082-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
